# Keystroke Analysis for Remote Authentication

This repository is where the research paper `Keystroke Analysis for Remote Authentication` by [Gabriel Padis](https://github.com/LordPompidou) and [Rim Zaafouri](https://github.com/rz160211), supervised by Dr Darragh Oâ€™Brien is made public.
In it is the final paper in pdf format, but also the literature review, the source datasets and the source code. We hope that this will be helpful to other when researching this topic.

## Usage

### What is here
* In `images/` are the images for the paper
* In `src/`
    * In `datasets/` is the used datasets, including the open dataset from Killourhy and Maxion
    * In `exports/` are exported graph from scripts and notebooks
